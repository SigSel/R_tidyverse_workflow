# R_tidyverse_workflow
This repository contains an example Github actions pipeline/workflow for running R scripts dependent on the tidyverse package.

## Overview
This approach was originally used in [another project](https://github.com/SigSel/react_jw_app). 
When I first started looking into R and Github actions I struggled to find out how to run R scripts dependent on the tidyverse package. 
The approach is quite time consuming due to the installation of all the dependencies, and was therefore replaced in that project.
This repository is created to preserve the knowledge and hopefully help other people looking to combine Github actions with R scripts using tidyverse.
